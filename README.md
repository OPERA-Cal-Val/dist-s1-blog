# dist-s1-blog

This is the repository for publishing the informal dist-s1 blog.

Main blog: https://opera-cal-val.github.io/dist-s1-blog/
Test blog: https://opera-cal-val.github.io/dist-s1-blog/test/

## Installation

- Install `hugo`
  - we used homebrew: `brew install hugo` 
  - can use `mamba` - do not use multiple hugos - otherwise will get tricky
  - great documentation at: https://gohugo.io/documentation/

## Usage

Once hugo is installed, view the site locally with `hugo serve`.

## Contributing

Make a PR to `dev` branch and once merged will publish to the test blog.
When we are ready, we can publish by merging to `main`.
Everything is public, but the test site makes sure things work first.

### Data

It's probably easiest to include data directly in the repository.
See the sample blog posts for examples.
